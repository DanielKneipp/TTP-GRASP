# Repetitive Greedy with Local Search (RGLS)

It’s a GRASP based approach created to solve the benchmark problem called Travelling Thief Problem (TTP).

Please, see the paper (doc/paper.pdf -- It’s in Brazilian Portuguese) for more about it and comparisons with another solver called Multi-Component Genetic Algorithm ([MCGA](https://github.com/DanielKneipp/GeneticAlgorithmTravelingThiefProblem)).
